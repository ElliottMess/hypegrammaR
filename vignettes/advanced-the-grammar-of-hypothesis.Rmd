##
define your survey design. Since it's a simple random design, we just pass the data and that's all. Now R knows that we're doing simple random sampling, so no need to bother with cluster/stratification stuff.

```{r}
# mydesign<-map_to_design(mydata)

# hypegrammaR:::barchart_with_error_bars(hypothesis.test.results = result$hypothesis.test,
#                                        summary.statistics = result$summary.statistic)

```
